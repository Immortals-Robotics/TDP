%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
This paper describes the recent works done by the Immortals team, a team consisting of undergraduate engineering students, currently focusing on the Small Size League. There were changes applied to the mechanics and electronics of the robots in the previuos year. This year, the team focused on solving the issues which were observed during the recent competitions including RoboCup 2018, Montr√©al. The goal is to reach to a reliable design where there is no need for any robot substitution due to damages during a match. In addition to the current robot, there is a 3D printed robot which was introduced in the previous year by this team and has been improved and tested in the recent competitions.
%In your abstract, please state your main research line and your achievements of this year (on which problem or set of problems are you focusing all the team efforts). Tell why this research is important, how are you approaching to the problem solution and which results do you expect to obtain.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Immortals Robotics Team is a team of undergraduate students from Sharif, Tehran and Pars University. The team started the Small Size League (SSL) project in the summer of 2007 and produced its first robot after one year, there have been major revisions made in the designs of the robots since then. In this paper the most recent changes on the designs and achivments made by the team will be shared with the reader whom, wants to design or modify an SSL robot. There is also a new type of robot which was introduced by this team in the past year known as the 3D-Printed robot [1,4].

%\section{TDP contents}
%While writing the TDP, focus on your current research, clearly stating all scientific contribution, and why are they important for you and the league. The length of the TDP is limited to 8 pages including references. Exceeding the number of pages will automatically void your application.
%
%Although reviewers share a common background in the domain of service robotics, is very unlikely that they are actively involved in your research field. The organizing committee kindly asks authors to keep this in mind and write in a more descriptive and less analytic way. The main goal of a TDP is tell others about your latest practical achievement, how your team managed to solve the problem, what strategy was chosen and why, while at the same time trying to convince your reader that what you are doing is useful or applicable in a daily life scenario.
%
%The Team Description Paper shall use the \textit{Springer LNAI format}\footnotemark used in the RoboCup Symposium submissions, and has a hard limit of 8 pages without altering margins or spacing (including references but excluding the annex). Please notice that changes to the margins, space between paragraphs, and font size are not allowed (such TDP will be rejected). We suggest to leave the hardware and software description for the end of the paper in the annex.\footnotetext{\url{http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0}}
%
%\textbf{Important Notice:} Attaching to the requested format is important for the camera ready version of the TDPs can be included in the memories of the competition.
%
%Remember that the TDP must contain the following information:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Innovative technology and scientific contribution
%	\item Focus of research/research interests
%	\item Re-usability of the system for other research groups
%	\item Applicability of the robot in the real world
%	\item \textbf{DSPL \& SSPL:} When the robot depicted in the TDP or Team Video is different from the league's standard one, the TDP must clearly state how the addressed approach and described software will be adapted to the standard platform robot.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\textbf{Remark:} The language for the TDP body, its graphics, tables, images, and all additional content must be English. Content in other languages must be translated.
%
%\subsection{TDP Annex}
%The TDP's Robot Description Annex is an appendix of arbitrary length that should be attached at the end of the TDP and summarizes the robot's software and hardware technical specifications.
%
%When present, the annex must contain the following information:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Photo(s) of the robot
%	\item \textbf{OPL only:} Brief, compact description of the robot's hardware.
%	\item \textbf{DSPL \& SSPL:} Please skip hardware description.
%	\item Brief, compact description of the robot's software (including commercial products, freeware, Open Source, etc.).
%	\item List of all external computing devices and the software running on them.
%	\item List of all cloud computing resources intended to be used.
%	\item Brief, compact description of all external devices (e.g. smart home devices, transceivers, helper robots, etc.).
%\end{itemize}
%
%Examples are provided at the end of this document in
%\hyperlink{page.9}{page~9~(DSPL)},
%\hyperlink{page.10}{page~10~(OPL)}, and
%\hyperlink{page.11}{page~11~(SSPL)}.
%
%\textbf{Copyright note:} All TDPs sent for qualification may be made publicly available in the RoboCup @Home Wiki for further reference. On submitting, teams implicitly grant permission to RoboCup @Home and the RoboCup Federation to copy, distribute, upload, publish, and use the manuscript to promote the event and the league at convenience.
